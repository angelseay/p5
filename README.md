# p5: Programming Assignment 5
 
## Project Description: 
For this project, we were tasked with designing and implementing an interactive visualization of the data. Since our chosen dataset involved movies, we created a video player background with fast forward and rewind buttons for our design. We then presented the movies by year to display variations in movies as time passes. See [description.pdf](https://github.com/angelseay/p5/blob/master/description.pdf) for a more in-depth description of the project as well as UI screenshots.
